I build reliable internal systems that reduce friction in complex engineering environments.

My work focuses on automation, internal tooling, and creating fast, safe feedback loops for engineers. Most repositories here are small, personal systems used to explore ideas, pressure-test approaches, and sharpen engineering judgment in the open.

What I work on

• Automation and tooling that runs in real developer environments  
• CI/CD systems as infrastructure, not just pipelines  
• Identity, access, and safety constraints in complex environments  
• Quality and reliability as system properties, not just test coverage  

How to use this profile

• Pinned repositories show the kinds of systems I think about and build  
• These are personal projects only — not employer or client work  
• Expect experiments, iterations, and trade-off exploration rather than polished products
