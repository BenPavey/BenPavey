## Ben Pavey

I build reliable internal systems that reduce friction in complex engineering environments.

My work focuses on automation, internal tooling, identity-aware workflows, and creating fast, safe feedback loops for engineers. Most repositories here are small, personal systems used to explore ideas, pressure-test approaches, and sharpen engineering judgment in the open.

### What I work on
- Automation and tooling that runs on real developer machines (macOS / Windows)
- CI/CD systems as infrastructure, not just pipelines
- Identity, access, and guardrails in regulated environments
- Quality and reliability as system properties, not just test coverage

### How to use this profile
- Pinned repositories show the kind of systems I think about and build
- These are personal projects only — not employer or client work
- Expect experiments, iterations, and trade-off exploration rather than polished products
